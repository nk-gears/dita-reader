# Contributing to R2D2BC

This document is a guideline about how to contribute to R2D2BC. If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.

## Community

Before making significant contributions, please join the [R2D2BC Slack team](https://join.slack.com/t/r2d2bc/shared_invite/zt-gisndbu8-ecMkJ3Z1tZL8QU7_x5eLRA) and discuss your plans.

## Contributing

Please make contributions to the project.  Anything from fixing typos to new features is welcomed.

We use the `develop` branch as the development branch.  All contributions must come from branches that are created from `develop`.

Here is a typical workflow for contributors:

1. Fork R2D2BC to your own GitHub repository. 
2. Clone your fork to a local repository.
3. Create a new branch from `develop`.
4. Prefix your branch name with `feature\` or `bugfix\` depending on what you are working on.
4. Keep your branch in sync with the upstream repository.
5. Commit your changes with an accurate and complete commit message.
6. Push your commits to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request from your fork to `r2d2bc\develop`.

After creating a PR, one or more reviewers will be assigned to the pull request.
If your PR contains large changes, please write detailed documents about its design and usage.
Note that a single pull request should not be too large.

If you find a typo or bug in the code, or want to request new features,
you can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/d-i-t-a/r2d2bc/issues/new).

### Code review

All code will be reviewed by one or more project committers. To make it easier on them please make sure that your contributions are well-documented, well-designed, and well-tested.
